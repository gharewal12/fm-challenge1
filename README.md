- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned about the use of following css properties

```css
display: flex;
```

Which I used to center the qr code.

```css
min-height: 100vh;
```

I used this to ensure the background color covers the entire viewport height.
